# --- Custom Prompt for Pricing Suggestions (Specific to this page) ---
# Keep this custom prompt as it fulfills a unique requirement
PRICING_SUGGESTIONS_PROMPT = """
You are a Competitive Intelligence Specialist with 25+ years of experience analyzing market positioning for luxury residential contractors in Washington State.

CONTEXT:
{context}

TASK:
Provide specific pricing strategy recommendations to improve bid win rates while maintaining appropriate profit margins for a high-end low voltage contractor based on the provided competitive context.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Suggest 3 specific, actionable pricing adjustments based *only* on the data in the CONTEXT section.
- For each suggestion, include potential implementation steps and expected outcomes (e.g., impact on win rate or perceived value).
- Focus on the luxury residential market in Seattle/Eastside.
- Consider competitor pricing patterns (if available in context) and project types (if available in context).

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Based on your competitive positioning (Win Rate: {win_rate:.1f}%, Avg Bid: ${avg_bid_amount:,.0f}, Avg Competitor Price: {avg_comp_price_str}), consider these pricing strategy adjustments:

1.  **Strategy 1:** [Description of strategy based on context data, e.g., Adjust pricing for 'Specific Project Type' where win rate is low/high]
    *   *Implementation:* [e.g., Conduct focused analysis on lost bids for this type, identify price sensitivity threshold]
    *   *Expected Outcome:* [e.g., Increase win rate for this type by X% without significantly impacting margin, Improve competitiveness in bids exceeding competitor prices by Y%]

2.  **Strategy 2:** [Description of strategy, e.g., Introduce value-based pricing for bids significantly below competitor prices]
    *   *Implementation:* [e.g., Develop standard value-add packages (extended warranty, premium support) to justify higher price points on certain bids]
    *   *Expected Outcome:* [e.g., Capture higher margin on bids where price isn't the primary deciding factor, increase average revenue per won bid]

3.  **Strategy 3:** [Description of strategy, e.g., Analyze competitor pricing data availability]
    *   *Implementation:* [e.g., Implement a system to consistently track competitor pricing when available on lost bids, refine data collection]
    *   *Expected Outcome:* [e.g., Enable more data-driven pricing decisions, identify specific competitors' pricing strategies]
